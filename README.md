# Multisig

This Multisig example application uses  can currently the [ga-multisig-contract](https://github.com/aeternity/ga-multisig-contract) to create a generalized accounts based n-of-m multi-signature account. Currently the UI only serves as an example to create and sign spend transactions, but support for any kind of transaction is possible in the future.
